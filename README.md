# WorldWise

### Simple project to check ur current geological positon and to select any place in the world and save its location and the data about it.

## Important note:
When starting the app, remember to run the npm run server command in a seperate terminal so we can emulate the server expirience with it.

## Features
* Emulated login

* Marking the map

* Getting data from marking the map

* Submitting to the "server"

* Reading your current location

* eeping the selected places on the map in a list

## Technological Decisions

* For starting the react app - Vite
* For styling - css modules
* For routing - react-router-dom
* For the map - Leaflet(react-leaflet and leaflet)
* For the dates - react-datepicker
* For catching errors - eslint
* For UI state managment - Context API
